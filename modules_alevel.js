    summary: 'Every network communication is broken into packets: discrete units with a header (source IP, destination IP, protocol, port, flags) and payload. A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) logs these flows. Key indicators: TCP SYN without ACK (SYN flood), sequential port increments (port scan), small queries generating large responses (amplification). Understanding the TCP three-way handshake (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK) and what each flag signals is essential for distinguishing attacks from legitimate traffic.',
    watchFor: 'Very high packet rate from a single source IP • SYN flag set without corresponding ACK responses • Sequential destination port numbers (reconnaissance scan) • Asymmetric request/response sizes (amplification vector) • Source IPs on threat intelligence blocklists or Tor exit node registries • Internal hosts initiating unusual outbound high-volume connections',
    realWorld: 'In September 2016 the Mirai botnet, comprising 100,000+ compromised IoT devices, attacked DNS provider Dyn at 1.2 Tbps using SYN floods and UDP amplification — taking Twitter, Reddit and Netflix offline for hours. The same botnet had previously attacked journalist Brian Krebs at 620 Gbps. Both attacks exploited default credentials on cameras and DVRs.'

As computing power increases, previously secure algorithms become vulnerable and must be replaced.',

    tagline: 'Evaluating network access control requests against security principles',
    summary: 'A firewall controls which traffic is permitted to enter and leave a network by matching packets against an ordered ruleset. Stateful firewalls additionally track connection state, allowing returning traffic for established sessions. Proxy servers add a layer between client and server, filtering content and masking internal IP addresses. The principle of least privilege mandates granting only the minimum access required. A single misconfigured rule — opening SSH or RDP to the internet, or allowing unrestricted outbound access — can compromise an entire network.',
    watchFor: 'Rules allowing inbound traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 (any IP — the entire internet) on sensitive ports • High-risk ports open to internet: 22 (SSH), 23 (Telnet), 3389 (RDP), 5900 (VNC) • Overly broad port ranges (0–65535 all ports) • Outbound rules to any destination with no destination restriction • Rules with vague justification ("business need", "developer request") • Any use of Telnet (unencrypted) instead of SSH',
    realWorld: 'The 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack exploited a legitimate firewall rule permitting the Orion monitoring software to make outbound HTTP connections to the internet. Attackers embedded a backdoor in a software update and used this rule as a covert C2 channel — the rule was never questioned because it appeared routine. Over 18,000 organisations were compromised before the attack was detected months later.'

    summary: 'Four UK laws govern computing: the Computer Misuse Act 1990 (CMA) criminalises unauthorised computer access — S1: unauthorised access (max 2 years); S2: unauthorised access with intent for further offence (max 5 years); S3: unauthorised acts impairing computer operation, e.g. malware deployment (max 10 years). The Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA) regulates personal data processing. The Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA) protects software as literary work. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) governs lawful interception of communications.',
    watchFor: 'Unauthorised system access → CMA S1 • Unauthorised access with further intent (e.g. accessing systems to steal data) → CMA S2 • Installing malware, modifying/deleting data without authority → CMA S3 • Personal data processed without consent, shared unlawfully, or retained beyond necessity → DPA 1998 • Copying or distributing software without licence → CDPA 1988 • Intercepting communications without lawful authority → RIPA 2000',
    realWorld: 'The CMA 1990 has been used in prosecutions ranging from a disgruntled employee deleting company files (S3) to a researcher who accessed a company database without authorisation even to expose a vulnerability (S1 — intent is irrelevant). In 2018, Facebook was fined £500,000 (the maximum under DPA 1998) by the ICO for the Cambridge Analytica scandal — demonstrating the DPA\'s enforcement reach. GDPR (2018) superseded and extended DPA 1998 with far higher maximum fines — but the four Acts above remain the foundation of UK computing law.'

    tagline: 'Identifying human-factor attacks that bypass technical controls',
    summary: "Social engineering attacks target people rather than systems. They exploit psychological principles: authority (the request comes from someone senior), urgency (act now or face consequences), scarcity (limited time window), social proof (others have already done this), and reciprocity. Phishing uses email; spear-phishing is personalised to the target; vishing uses phone calls; smishing uses SMS. Pretexting builds a fabricated scenario to establish trust. Baiting uses physical media or digital lures. CEO fraud (Business Email Compromise) impersonates executives to authorise fraudulent payments. The defence is always verification through a separate, pre-established channel — not the one the attacker is using.",
    watchFor: 'Requests for credentials, passwords or MFA codes — no legitimate IT team will ask for these • Unusual urgency: "act now or your account will be deleted" • Requests to bypass normal processes or keep the contact secret • Claimed identities that cannot be independently verified • Any request for financial transfers outside normal procurement channels • Unexpected physical access requests to secure areas',
    realWorld: "In 2020, attackers called Twitter's internal IT support, impersonated employees, and convinced staff to hand over admin credentials. Within hours they had compromised 130 high-profile accounts including Barack Obama, Elon Musk and Apple, posting a Bitcoin scam that generated $120,000 in two hours. No malware was used. The entire attack was a phone call."

    summary: 'Malware is software designed to disrupt, damage or gain unauthorised access to a system. Key types: a virus attaches to legitimate files and requires user action to spread; a worm self-replicates across a network without user interaction; a trojan appears legitimate but contains malicious functionality; ransomware encrypts files and demands payment; spyware silently collects data; a keylogger captures keystrokes to steal credentials; a rootkit hides its presence by modifying the operating system. Indicators of compromise (IoCs) include: processes running from unexpected paths (Temp folders, AppData), unexpected network connections, high file write rates, and legitimate process names run from wrong directories.',
    watchFor: 'Processes running from C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Temp or random-named directories — legitimate system processes run from C:\\Windows\\System32 • A process making outbound connections to non-business IP addresses on a schedule • Rapid file modifications with new extensions appearing (.encrypted, .locked) • PowerShell or cmd.exe launched with -EncodedCommand or -ExecutionPolicy Bypass flags • A known system process name (svchost.exe) running from an unexpected path — process name spoofing • Extremely high disk write rates on a file server',
    realWorld: 'In May 2017 WannaCry ransomware encrypted computers in 150 countries within hours, including approximately one-third of NHS trusts in England. It exploited an unpatched Windows SMB vulnerability (EternalBlue), self-replicated as a worm across networks, then encrypted files and demanded Bitcoin. The NHS cancellations cost an estimated £92 million. The kill switch — a hardcoded domain that WannaCry checked before encrypting — was accidentally discovered by a security researcher who registered it for £8.'

    analogy: 'Analysing EDR logs is like checking CCTV of a building where you know a thief has been. Most people on camera are legitimate — but the thief is using a stolen uniform. You look for people behaving like a thief (going through filing cabinets, copying files) or wearing the uniform wrong (wrong building, wrong floor, wrong time).',
    whatHappened: 'The endpoint estate contained a mixture of active malware (ransomware, keylogger, worm, trojan, spyware, and malicious PowerShell) alongside entirely legitimate system processes exhibiting similar surface-level behaviour (high CPU, file access, network connections). The analysis required understanding what each process should be doing, not just what it is doing.',
    keyMove: 'Wrong path = red flag (svchost.exe should be in System32, not AppData\\Temp). Rapid file modifications + new extensions = ransomware. Self-copying to network shares via SMB = worm. Reverse shell to external IP = trojan/RAT. Regular outbound connections to non-business IP = C2. MsMpEng.exe + high CPU = Defender scan (GREEN).',
    realWorld: "WannaCry (2017) combined a worm's self-replication with ransomware's encryption payload. It spread to roughly 200,000 systems across 150 countries in a single day — including a third of NHS trusts. The kill switch, a single unregistered domain in the malware's code, was discovered and registered for £8, stopping the spread. Endpoint isolation and patching the SMB vulnerability (EternalBlue) were the remediation steps.",
    quiz:[
      {q:'What is the fundamental difference between a worm and a virus?',options:['A virus encrypts files; a worm only monitors network traffic','A worm self-replicates across a network without any user interaction; a virus attaches to files and requires user action (opening the file) to spread','A worm targets mobile devices; a virus targets desktop operating systems'],correct:1},
      {q:'A trojan horse differs from other malware primarily because:',options:['It can only infect systems running Windows operating systems','It presents as a legitimate, useful application while secretly performing malicious actions','It spreads automatically via email attachments without user interaction'],correct:1},
      {q:'Ransomware\'s final visible impact on a victim is typically:',options:['Silently exfiltrating data to an external server over several weeks','Displaying a ransom demand after encrypting the victim\'s files, making them inaccessible','Deleting all files without the possibility of recovery, even after payment'],correct:1},
      {q:'A process named svchost.exe running from C:\\Users\\jsmith\\AppData\\Temp\\ is immediately suspicious because:',options:['svchost.exe is not a valid Windows process name','The legitimate Windows svchost.exe runs only from C:\\Windows\\System32 — any copy elsewhere indicates process name spoofing','All processes in AppData require administrator approval before running'],correct:1},
      {q:'PowerShell launched with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand flags most likely indicates:',options:['A legitimate administrator running a scheduled maintenance script requiring elevated permissions','Malicious activity: the flags override script signing requirements, hide the window from the user and encode the payload to evade detection','A Windows Update process configuring system policies'],correct:1},
      {q:'Which malware type is specifically designed to intercept and record keyboard input in order to steal credentials?',options:['Spyware — which monitors all user activity including browser history and emails','A keylogger — which focuses specifically on capturing what the user types','A rootkit — which hides the presence of other malware from the operating system'],correct:1},
      {q:'A botnet client on an infected machine would most characteristically show which behaviour in EDR logs?',options:['Extremely high CPU usage continuously, indicating cryptomining','Periodic, scheduled outbound connections to an external IP address on a fixed interval — awaiting instructions from the command and control server','Rapid deletion of system log files to cover its tracks'],correct:1},
      {q:'Spyware differs from a keylogger in that it:',options:['Only targets smartphones and tablet devices, not desktop systems','Captures a broader range of data — screenshots, browser history, saved credentials and clipboard contents — not just keyboard input','Must be installed manually by an attacker with physical access to the device'],correct:1},
      {q:'The WannaCry ransomware spread so rapidly because it combined ransomware behaviour with which other malware capability?',options:['Rootkit functionality — it hid itself from antivirus tools on each infected machine','Worm functionality — it self-replicated across networks by exploiting an SMB vulnerability without any user interaction','Trojan functionality — it disguised itself as a Windows system update'],correct:1},
    
      {q:'How does a rootkit differ from other malware types?',options:['A rootkit encrypts files and demands payment for decryption — the key difference from ransomware','A rootkit modifies the operating system to hide the presence of other malware — making standard detection tools unreliable on an infected host','A rootkit spreads automatically across a network; other malware types require user interaction'],correct:1},
      {q:'What is cryptojacking?',options:['Stealing encrypted files and ransoming the decryption key','Using a victim\'s computer resources without their knowledge to mine cryptocurrency — causing high CPU usage and electricity costs','Intercepting and decrypting HTTPS traffic by compromising a certificate authority'],correct:1},
      {q:'What is lateral movement in the context of a network intrusion?',options:['The attacker redirecting traffic from one server to another to avoid detection','The attacker moving from the initially compromised machine to other systems on the same network, expanding their access','The attacker using a VPN to make their traffic appear to come from a different geographic location'],correct:1},
      {q:'A backdoor differs from a trojan horse in that:',options:['A backdoor is always installed by the attacker manually; a trojan is always distributed via email','A backdoor specifically provides persistent remote access to a system; a trojan is a broader term for malware disguised as legitimate software (which may include a backdoor)','A backdoor only targets Windows systems; trojans work across all operating systems'],correct:1},
      {q:'What is an Indicator of Compromise (IoC)?',options:['A formal legal notice that a system has been certified as secure','Forensic evidence suggesting a system has been breached — e.g. a suspicious process, unexpected network connection, or new registry key','A risk score assigned to a vulnerability based on its potential impact and exploitability'],correct:1},
      {q:'The WannaCry ransomware spread so rapidly in 2017 because it combined which two capabilities?',options:['Keylogging and screen capture — allowing it to steal credentials from each infected machine before spreading','Worm functionality (self-replication via an SMB vulnerability) and ransomware (encrypting files) — no user action required to propagate','Trojan installation and rootkit concealment — making it invisible to standard antivirus tools'],correct:1},
